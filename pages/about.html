    <h5> About Fantasy Football </h5>
    <p>Fantasy sports is a type of game where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a
    professional sport. These teams compete based on statistical performance and converted into points that are compiled and
    totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team user. The application will allow you to create an account
    which then will allow enabled users to pick their team and allow them to add them to a roster which will enable them to
    accumulate points based on their performance. In the roster, the player will be able to add, remove, and trade players.
    When potential points are being accumulated based on their statistical performance, a notification will be sent for the
    user to watch a live feed of the event. The user with the most points accumulated wins.
